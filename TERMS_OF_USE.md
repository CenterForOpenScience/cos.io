**CENTER FOR OPEN SCIENCE, INC.**  
**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE**

1. **INTRODUCTION**

  Center for Open Science, Inc. (referred to as "the COS", "Open Science Framework", "OSF", "us" "our" and "we") is a nonprofit organization that operates certain websites at the cos.io (or centerforopenscience.org) and the osf.io (or openscienceframework.org) URLs ("Websites" or "Services"). The COS conducts research on scientific practices and provides grants for relevant projects.  The COS fosters an open and interactive community among open source developers, open science researchers, and the broader scientific community.  We also support and improve the scientific workflow by connecting technologies that researchers use by means of our development and administration of the Open Science Framework.  

  Our mission is to increase the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research and scholarly communication by creating and operating an open access infrastructure (referred to as "OSF" or the "Framework") to support the entire research lifecycle from planning, execution, reporting, archiving and discovery.  The use of our Websites and Services are free of charge.  These Terms of Use apply to contributors of content to, and users of, our Websites and Services.

  These Terms of Use describe the conditions under which the COS allows the public to use the Websites and Services.  

2. **TERMS OF USE**

  In order to use the Websites and Services made available on the sites, whether by accessing our Websites directly or by using a public application programming interface ("Public API") to access our Websites and Services, you must first agree to these Terms of Use.  You may not use the Websites or Services if you do not accept these terms.  You can accept these terms by clicking to accept or agree to these terms where we've provided you with clickable electronic assent option or by actually using the services offered at the Websites.  If you are using the Websites or Services on behalf of a business or organization, your assent to these terms constitutes a binding legal agreement that that business or organization for which you're acting as a representative accepts these terms.  Any such business or organization will hold harmless and indemnify the COS, and its agents and representatives, and its and their directors, officers and employees from and against any liability, damage, loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to its and your use of the Websites and Services, including data or software deposited by you or it, or in violation of these Terms of Use. You understand and agree that we will treat your use of the Websites and Services offered thereon as acceptance of these terms. 

  Our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/centerforopenscience.org/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use, explains how we treat your personal data and your privacy when you use our Websites and Services. By using our Websites and Services, you agree that the COS can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. 

3. **MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF USE**

  We may modify these Terms of Use from time to time by posting a revised version on our Websites and/or Services.  Your continued use of the Websites or Services after the posting of such new Terms of Use means that you agree to the posted changes.  If you do not agree to the changes, you should discontinue use of the Websites and Services.  If there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and the updated and/or additional terms and conditions, the updated and/or additional terms and conditions will control. 

  If you have questions about our Websites and Services, please contact us by email us at contact@cos.io. 

4. **DEFINITIONS**

  In this document, we use "you" to refer to researchers and other users of the Websites and OSF.  We also use the following defined terms:

  a.  Project.  A "Project" is an individual or collaborative enterprise that also may have embedded within it subproject(s) or "Project components" or "component(s)" of the Project.

  b.  Content.  As used in these Terms of Use, "content" means, but is not limited to, any research, data, text, images, software and software code, data sets, information or other materials.

  c.  Users.  All Users must accept the COS Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

    1. Administrator.  An administrator on a Project or a component is an individual who has full rights to control all aspects of a Project.  An Administrator may create a Project or components of a Project, create and change contributor permissions, identify the legal terms that govern the ownership of the intellectual property in Content deposited into a Project or a Project component or identify the license restrictions governing the use of the intellectual property incorporated into the Project or a Project component, control and modify access and privacy settings for the Project and its components, modify license terms for the use of Content, invite other users to contribute to a Project or a component of a project, authorize add-ons, namely, software designed to increase the capability of OSF, remove Projects or Project Components from the Websites and Services, register (i.e. freeze and uniquely identify) Projects or Project Components.  Administrators must have the authority to bind the individual Administrator's business, organization or institution to the COS's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

    2. Proxy.  A Proxy is a person to whom the Administrator has granted the authority to manage a Project or Project component on his or her behalf, which may include setting and modifying user access, privacy settings, license terms, and editing and depositing Content.   

    3. Contributing User.  A Contributing User may access, deposit, and edit Content to a Project or a Project component.

    4. Active User.  An Active User may have select interactive use of the Websites and Services, subject to restrictions imposed by the Administrator.  

    5. Passive User.  A passive user, including journal editors/reviewers, other scientists, and members of the general public, may use the Websites and Services solely as an information resource without any ability to change or modify any Project content.

  d.  Public API: An application program interface available to the public to facilitate computer communication with the OSF.  Parts or all of the Websites and Services are accessible via various Public APIs, including but not limited to, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google Scholar and Google Groups, and LinkedIn.

  e. Privacy Settings.  Privacy Settings define whether Project Content may be publicly displayed, displayed with restricted access to a limited group, or private.  

  f. Trusted Party:  A Trusted Party is an individual or organization to which the Administrator has given the right to view, edit, and/or deposit specific data within a Project or Project component.    

5. **YOUR RIGHT TO USE OSF**

  The Websites and OSF contain technology that is  owned by the COS or third parties and materials, including the OSF, that are owned by the COS or its third party licensors. The COS makes the OSF software available on an open source basis.  The COS grants you a limited license to make use of the OSF software on which the OSF is based and the Public API to access and search the Websites and Services.  In addition, the COS grants you a license to use any Content marked "public," subject to patent, copyright and trademark law and these Terms of Use, including the limits described in the section governing Limitations on Use below.  By "use" we mean sublicense, reproduce, store, transmit, distribute, and publicly display the Content for non-commercial and commercial uses.   If a Project contains links to full text articles or other materials, this license does not extend to the linked materials.  You may download and modify Content, but only in manner consistent with copyright law and that does not make the data false or misleading. Additional restrictions may apply with respect to specific Content, in which case these restrictions will be identified with the Content.        

6. **PRIVACY SETTINGS RESTRICTING ACCESS TO CONTENT**

  The COS supports open access to information in the research community.  The COS shares with the public free of charge any data marked as Public through its Websites and Services for viewing and use, including commercial uses, unless otherwise noted. 
  If you deposit Content into OSF, you still own the Content, but you grant the COS and its authorized users a license to use it.  Specifically, by depositing any Content (including data and links, but not the linked content) in a COS account, you grant the COS and its users a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to sublicense, reproduce, store, modify, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display such Content, subject to the Privacy Settings the Administrator or Proxy selects.  This limited license continues even after you stop using the COS database.  If you or the Administrator previously made Content publicly available through the Websites and Services, there is no way to stop the public from continuing to use that Content, given the public nature of the Internet.  

  If you contribute software code designed to modify and enhance the OSF, the underlying technology platform upon which all Projects are stored, you continue to own the code, but you grant the COS and its authorized users a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to sublicense, reproduce, store, modify, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display the code, subject to the terms of the open source license the COS designates. 

  Our Privacy Settings for Projects are summarized below.  

  a. Public. Content marked as "Public" will be available to the public for viewing and commercial and non-commercial use under the terms of the license identified by the Administrator.  

  b. Private.  Content marked as "Private" may be viewed through the OSF or Public API only by the Administrator(s), a Contributing User of that Project or Component, anyone with a view-only link created by an Administrator, or any designated Proxy. Private data are not shared with the public, Trusted Parties or other members of the COS.  Only the COS employees and our authorized agents' or contractors' staff, with a "need to know" access to manage the Websites and Services and process data for the COS are able to view Private Access Data. 

7. **YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

  You represent and warrant to the COS that: 

  a.  If you host a Project on the OSF, you are authorized to do so with the COS and that you have the authority to bind the business or organization that you represent to these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

  b.  If you are an Administrator, you are not misrepresenting your identity or organizational affiliations in any manner. 

  c.  All data you deposit is true and correct at the time of deposit.  If you later discover that any data was not true and correct at the time of deposit, you must correct the data. 

  d.  The license you grant to the COS and the public to any content, data, texts, blogs, software code, data sets, links or other materials, or other content you deposit, does not infringe on the copyright or other rights of a third party.  

  e.  If you are a registered user, you will update and maintain the accuracy of your contact information.  

8. **AUDIT TRAILS**

  To ensure the transparency of the COS and as a feature of the OSF, we may, but are not required to, keep an audit trail log when and by whom Project data or information has been deposited or changed and any changes to a Project's privacy settings.  While the COS requires all data deposited be accurate, the COS takes no responsibility for the accuracy of the data on the Websites or the Services.  You agree to hold the COS and its representatives and agents, and its and their directors, officers and employees, harmless regarding any disputes regarding data deposits and privacy settings and any claims, regardless of theory of law, arising from such disputes. 

9. **PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES**

  The COS is an open service developed by and for the research community. We encourage you to consider community norms and expectations in your use of the Websites and Services. 

  You may not use the Websites or Services to violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law, including without limitation any applicable laws relating to antitrust or other illegal trade or business practices, federal and state securities laws, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, and any U.S. laws, rules, and regulations governing the export and re-export of commodities or technical data. You may not upload or transmit any data, content, or material that infringes or misappropriates any person's copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, or disclose via the Websites or Services any information the disclosure of which would constitute a violation of any confidentiality obligation on your part. You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer code, nor subject the COS's networks or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or otherwise engage in conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the COS's Websites and Services.  You're strictly prohibited from communicating on or through this site any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law.  You are further prohibited from harvesting addresses, email addresses or other personal data for commercial purposes and from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or other unsolicited communications to other users of the Websites or Services.  You may not use the Websites or Services in a way that harms the COS or the COS's members, affiliates or vendors, or other users.  You may not deposit, edit, modify or otherwise use any data in a manner that makes it false, incomplete or misleading. You may not manipulate identifiers to disguise the origin of any data. You may not use COS or the COS marks in any way to suggest an affiliation with or endorsement by the COS of any individual, organization, product, service, or research.

  You acknowledge that your unauthorized use or misuse of the Websites and Services could cause the COS irreparable harm.  Any unauthorized use of the Websites or Services or other breach of these Terms of Use shall automatically terminate the license granted to you by the COS.  In addition, the COS reserves the right, but is not obligated to, investigate any potential violations of its Terms of Use and/or any behavior that is potentially unlawful, and such investigations may involve cooperation with law enforcement authorities.    

10.  **LIMITATION OF ACCESS AND REMOVAL OF CONTENT**

  The COS makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and provide access to its Websites and Services and will endeavor to provide you with advance warning of restrictions to access due to routine website maintenance.  The COS, at its sole discretion, however, reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Websites or Services or portions thereof with or without notice.  You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, discontinuation or termination of the Websites or Services.    While the COS will endeavor to continue to host all Projects, as a non-profit entity, it cannot guarantee that it will have the resources to do so over time, and it reserves the right to designate a substitute host of its choosing for Project content if the COS does not have the financial means to do so itself in the future.  

  The COS is not responsible for screening or reviewing content submitted to the Websites or Services.  The COS may temporarily or permanently remove any content on the Websites or Services at any time where the COS, in its sole discretion believes the content is in violation of these Terms of Service or where the COS is acting in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  You are advised not to use the Websites or Services as the exclusive storage repository for your data and content.  The COS recommends that you separately store all data and content submitted to the Websites and Services on other secure servers or with reputable third party hosting services. 

11. **SECURITY**

  The COS uses commercially reasonable, industry-standard measures to protect the security of the COS's Websites and its Services.  Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not be able to defeat our security measures. Your access to some of our Websites and Services and content may be password protected. To maintain the security of your information (or another user's personal information that you are authorized to manage as an Administrator), you must keep your username(s) and password(s) strictly confidential and not disclose them to anyone.  You will be solely responsible for any action, activities, and access to our Websites and Services that are taken using your username and password and that occurred before you notified us of their loss.  If you become aware of any security breach of your password or of the security of the Websites or Services, you must contact us as soon as possible.     

12. **LINKS AND ADD-ONS**

  The Websites and Services may contain links or allow you to make use of Add-ons that connect to sites owned or operated by independent third parties. These links are provided for your convenience and reference only.  The COS's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy do not apply to those sites.  We do not control such sites and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites or their privacy policies. The fact that the COS offers such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or products or services referenced therein, and the COS reserves the right to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement of these sites. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the COS's Websites or Services, you do this entirely at your own risk.  Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the COS cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third party sites or any results that may be obtained from using them.  You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites. 

13. **INDEMNIFICATION**

  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the COS, its employees, directors, officers, affiliated companies, agents, vendors or suppliers from and against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from or related to your use or misuse of the Websites and Services, including, without limitation, your use of any Public API or third party products accessing the Websites or Services via a Public API, your violation of these Terms of Use, or your infringement or that of any other user of your account, of any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity.

14. **TERMINATION** 

  These Terms of Use are effective until terminated by either party. If you no longer agree to be bound by these Terms, you must cease use of the Websites and Services.  If you're dissatisfied with the Websites, their content, our Services or any of these terms, conditions, and policies, your sole legal remedy is to discontinue using the Websites and Services.  The COS reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Websites and Services, or parts of the Websites and Services, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such use is (i) in violation of any applicable law; (ii) is harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of another person or entity; or (iii) where the COS has reason to believe that you are in violation of these Terms of Use. Termination for any reason shall not terminate any of your warranties or any of your  indemnification and other obligations under these Terms of Use, or any licenses that you have license, use or other rights that you may have granted in connection with any of your contributions.

15.   **WARRANTY DISCLAIMER**

  THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.  TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

THIS DISCLAIMER CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.

YOUR USE AND PARTICIPATION IN THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE COS OR THROUGH THE COS, ITS EMPLOYEES, OR THIRD PARTIES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, BY YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES, THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  

16. **LIABILITY LIMITATION**

  THE COS'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE WILL NOT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ($1,000.00).

17. **USE OF SOFTWARE**

  If you download code or software tools (the "Software") from the Websites or Services, the use of the Software is subject to the license terms in the Software License Agreement that accompanies or is provided with the Software. If a Software License Agreement does not accompany or is not provided with the Software and the Software is sample or beta code or is provided for evaluation purposes, then you must contact the Project Administrator for the applicable Software License Agreement.  You may not download or install the Software until you have read and accepted the terms of the applicable Software License Agreement.

18. **TRADEMARKS**

  Center for Open Science, COS, Open Science Framework, OSF and their associated logos (collectively, "COS Marks") are trademarks or service marks of the COS and/or its licensors and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of the COS or the applicable trademark holder.

21. **GENERAL**

The COS is based in the United States.  The COS makes no claims that the data or content on its Websites or Services is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the Websites and Services may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Websites from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.  These Terms are governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding that state's conflicts of laws provisions.  Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Websites or Services must be brought in the state or federal courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you may have with respect to your use of the Websites or Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.  The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms, and you expressly waive all rights of application or appeal, if any, to non-U.S. courts in connection with any question of law.  A party may give notice to the other party only in writing at that party's principal place of business, attention of that party's principal legal officer, or at such other address or by such other method as the party shall specify in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or facsimile with proof of receipt of transmission, or, if sent by certified mail with postage prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing. If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being affected in any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section. The failure of the COS to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit the COS's rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.  These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties, and supersede any and all oral or written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to their subject matter.  

22. **RESERVATIONS OF RIGHTS**

  All rights not explicitly granted herein are reserved. 

23. **QUESTIONS**
