## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE

### 1. INTRODUCTION 
Center for Open Science, Inc. (referred to as "COS", "OSF", "us" "our" and "we") is a nonprofit culture change organization that aims to align scholarly values with scholarly practices. It does so by developing and advancing a systems strategy for changing culture and behavior toward greater rigor, transparency, and sharing of research process, outputs, and outcomes. COS fosters an open and interactive community among open source developers, open science researchers, and the broader scientific community through our in-person and virtual events; runs programs, certifications, and fellowships with communities and related affiliates; conducts research on scientific practices and provides grants for relevant projects; and improves the research workflow by connecting technologies that researchers use through our development and maintenance of OSF.

Our mission is to increase the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research and scholarly communication by creating and operating an open source infrastructure (referred to as "OSF") to support the entire research lifecycle from planning, collaborating, conducting, reporting, publishing, archiving and discovery. These Terms of Use apply to contributors of content to, and users of, our Websites and Services (defined below). COS operates certain websites at cos.io (or centerforopenscience.org) and osf.io (or openscienceframework.org) and other URLs operated and maintained by COS ("Websites") which provide functionality ("Services") to our users.

These Terms of Use describe the conditions under which the COS allows the public to use the Websites and Services. The related [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/cos.io/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) is a notice to our users about how we manage your data.

Your use of the OSF Software is subject to the terms of such license. In addition, the COS grants you a license to use any Content marked "public," subject to patent, copyright and trademark law and these Terms of Use, including the limits described in the section governing Limitations on Use below. By "use" we mean sublicense, reproduce, store, transmit, distribute, and publicly display the Content for non-commercial and commercial uses. If a Project contains links to full-text articles or other content (“Content”), this license does not extend to the linked Content. You may download and modify Content, but only in a manner consistent with copyright law and that does not make the data false or misleading. Additional restrictions may apply with respect to specific Content, and are detailed in our service-specific content guidelines.

### 6. RESTRICTING ACCESS TO CONTENT
The COS supports open access to information in the research community. The COS shares with the public free of charge any data marked as Public through its Websites and Services for viewing and use unless otherwise noted. If you deposit Content into OSF, you still own the Content, but you grant the COS and its authorized users a license to use it. Specifically, by depositing any Content (including data and links, but not the linked content) in an OSF account, you grant the COS a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to store, reproduce, transmit, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display such Content, subject to the Privacy Settings the Administrator or Proxy selects. You grant its users a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, publicly display, and publicly perform such Content, subject to the Privacy Settings the Administrator or Proxy selects. This limited license continues even after you stop using the COS database. If you or the Administrator previously made Content publicly available through the Websites and Services, there is no way to stop the public from continuing to use that Content. You may grant further rights if you apply a license. 
If you contribute software code designed to modify and enhance the OSF, the underlying technology platform upon which all Projects, Registrations, and Preprints are stored, you continue to own the code, but you grant the COS and its authorized users a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to sublicense, reproduce, store, modify, transmit, distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display the code, subject to the terms of the open-source license the COS designates.

Our Privacy Settings for Content are summarized below.

**Private.** Content marked as "Private" may be viewed through the OSF or Public API only by the Administrator(s), a Contributing User of that Project or Component, anyone with a view-only link created by an Administrator, or any designated Proxy. Private data are not shared with the public, Trusted Parties, or other members of the COS. Only the COS employees and our authorized agents' or contractors' staff with a need to access to manage the Websites and Services and process Data for the COS are granted access rights to view such Data.  

**Embargoed.** Content marked as “Embargoed” may be viewed through the OSF or Public API only by the Administrator(s), a Contributing User of that Project or Component, anyone with a view-only link created by an Administrator, or any designated Proxy, until the Embargo date has passed, at which time the content will be made Public automatically.

Your violation of any of these representations and warranties may result in the suspension of your right to use the Website or Services, as well as other remedies available to COS.

### 8. AUDIT TRAILS
To ensure the transparency of the COS and as a feature of the OSF, we may, but are not required to, keep an audit trail log when and by whom Project data or information has been deposited or changed and any changes to a Project's privacy settings. While the COS requires all data deposited be accurate, the COS takes no responsibility for the accuracy of the data on the Websites or the Services. Each party agrees to hold the other party and its representatives and agents, and directors, officers and employees harmless regarding any disputes regarding data deposits and privacy settings and any claims, regardless of theory of law, arising from such disputes. 

### 9. PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES
The COS operates open services developed by and for the research community. We encourage you to consider community norms and expectations in your use of the Websites and Services.

You may not use the Websites or Services to violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law, including without limitation any applicable laws relating to antitrust or other illegal trade or business practices, federal and state securities laws, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, and any U.S. laws, rules, and regulations governing the export and re-export of commodities or technical data. You may not upload or transmit any data, content, or material that infringes or misappropriates any person's copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, or disclose via the Websites or Services any information the disclosure of which would constitute a violation of any confidentiality obligation on your part. You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer code, nor subject the COS's networks or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or otherwise engage in conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the COS's Websites and Services. You're strictly prohibited from communicating on or through this site any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law. You are further prohibited from harvesting addresses, email addresses, or other personal data for commercial purposes and from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or other unsolicited communications to other users of the Websites or Services. You may not use the Websites or Services in a way that harms the COS or the COS's members, affiliates or vendors, or other users. You may not deposit, edit, modify, or otherwise use any data in a manner that makes it false, incomplete or misleading, except to anonymize or protect identifying information as required by ethical or legal prescriptions for sharing data. You may not manipulate identifiers to disguise the origin of any data. You may not use COS or the COS marks in any way to suggest an affiliation with or endorsement by the COS of any individual, organization, product, service, or research.


You acknowledge that your unauthorized use or misuse of the Websites and Services could cause the COS irreparable harm. Any unauthorized use of the Websites or Services or other breach of these Terms of Use shall automatically terminate the license granted to you by the COS subject to an appeals process. In addition, the COS reserves the right, but is not obligated to, investigate any potential violations of its Terms of Use and/or any behavior that is potentially unlawful, and such investigations may involve cooperation with law enforcement authorities. 

### 10. LIMITATION OF ACCESS AND REMOVAL OF CONTENT
The COS makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and provide access to its Websites and Services and will endeavor to provide you with advance warning of restrictions to access due to routine website maintenance. The COS, at its sole discretion, however, reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Websites or Services or portions thereof with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, discontinuation, or termination of the Websites or Services. While the COS will endeavor to continue to host all Projects, as a non-profit entity, it cannot guarantee that it will have the resources to do so over time, and it reserves the right to designate a substitute host of its choosing for Project content if the COS does not have the financial means to do so itself in the future.

The COS is not responsible for screening or reviewing content submitted to the Websites or Services. The COS may temporarily or permanently remove any content on the Websites or Services at any time where the COS, in its sole discretion believes the content is in violation of these Terms of Use or where the COS is acting in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You are advised not to use the Websites or Services as the exclusive storage repository for your data and content. The COS recommends that you separately store all data and content submitted to the Websites and Services on other secure servers or with reputable third-party hosting services. 

### 11. SECURITY
The COS uses commercially reasonable, industry-standard measures to protect the security of the COS's Websites and Services. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not be able to defeat our security measures. Your access to some of our Websites and Services and content may be password-protected. To maintain the security of your information (or another user's personal information that you are authorized to manage as an Administrator), you must keep your username(s) and password(s) strictly confidential and not disclose them to anyone. You will be solely responsible for any action, activities, and access to our Websites and Services that are taken using your username and password and that occurred before you notified us of their loss. If you become aware of any security breach of your password or of the security of the Websites or Services, you must contact COS as soon as possible. 

### 12. LINKS AND ADD-ONS
The Websites and Services may contain links or allow you to make use of Add-ons that connect to sites owned or operated by independent third parties. These links are provided for your convenience and reference only. The COS's Terms of Use does not apply to those sites. We do not control such sites and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites or their privacy policies. The fact that the COS offers such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or products or services referenced therein, and the COS reserves the right to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement of these sites. If you decide to access any of the third-party sites linked to the COS's Websites or Services, you do this entirely at your own risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the COS cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third-party sites or any results that may be obtained from using them. You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites. 

### 13. OSF SINGLE SIGN-ON AUTHENTICATION
The following terms apply to affiliated users who sign into or register for an account on the OSF by using Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication and their credentials associated with an  OSF Institutional member. These terms in no way counter or replace any other terms in the COS Terms of Use.

Single Sign-On (SSO). Refers to an authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials.

SSO Integration. When accessing the OSF through SSO, users will be authenticated by their institution's identity provider (IdP). Your institution's IdP is responsible for managing user credentials and authentication.

Institutional Credentials. Users must use their institutional credentials for SSO access. OSF does not manage or store institutional login credentials; these are handled exclusively by your institution’s IdP.

User Access. Access to the OSF through SSO is contingent upon the validity of the user’s credentials as verified by the institution’s IdP. If access is denied or suspended by the institution, the user may access the OSF via another login method. No user data is lost or locked due to losing access to their institutional credentials. 

Data Transmission. The OSF does not receive or store your institution’s authentication credentials. We only receive and process the user’s identity information as provided by the IdP.

Data Security. While the OSF strives to ensure the security of transmitted data, the security of your credentials and the IdP's authentication processes are the responsibility of your institution.

Data Visibility. Your content maintains the same access and permission options as described in the COS Terms of Use, Section 6 “Privacy Settings Restricting Access to Content”. Administrators from your institution will see your affiliated public content in an insights dashboard, as well as the existence of and storage location of your private content in the aggregate. They will also see the email address associated with your SSO credentials. Some institutions will also share your department, which is only visible to institutional administrators.

Institutional Access Request. An administrator from your institution may contact you through OSF and may request permission to be added as a contributor on your content. You will be notified of the request by the OSF via email, and requests are visible on your content contributor page. Institutional administrators cannot make any modifications to your content without your express approval of these requests.

Institutional Responsibilities. Your institution is responsible for managing user accounts on their IdP. Any issues related to institutional credentials should be addressed directly with the institution.

Service Responsibilities. The OSF will ensure that any data transmitted through SSO is handled in accordance with our Terms of Use, as well as the SSO Addendum.
User Responsibilities. Users must comply with both their institution's policies and the COS Terms of Use. Unauthorized access or use of the OSF is prohibited. You should refer to your institution for any relevant policies that they maintain.

Access via SSO Termination. If your institution’s agreement with COS is terminated, or if your institutional access rights are revoked, access to the Websites and/or Services via your institutional sign in will also be terminated. Your account access and your data are not affected.

Account Closure. Users should contact their institution’s IT department to address any issues related to institutional credentials closure or access rights. Closing the OSF account will have no effect on the user’s institutional credentials.

Modifications. COS reserves the right to modify SSO integrations and workflows at any time. Any changes will be communicated to users, and continued use of the OSF constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.


Inquiries. For questions or issues regarding SSO access, please contact support@osf.io. Institutional administrators that have questions or requests should inquire at institutions@cos.io

### 14. INDEMNIFICATION
To the extent authorized by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless COS, its employees, directors, officers, affiliated companies, agents, vendors, or suppliers from and against any and all claims, damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that are incurred in connection with any third-party claim arising from or related to your use or misuse of the Websites and Services, including, without limitation, your use of any Public API or third-party products accessing the Websites or Services via a Public API, your violation of these Terms of Use, or your infringement or that of any other user of your account, of any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity. In turn, COS indemnifies you for any claims purporting to arise from allegations that the OSF Software (but not Content uploaded to it) infringes the patent or copyrights of a third party.

### 15. TERMINATION
These Terms of Use are effective until terminated by either party. If you no longer agree to be bound by these Terms, you must cease use of the Websites and Services. If you're dissatisfied with the Websites, their content, our Services or any of these terms, conditions, and policies, your sole legal remedy is to discontinue using the Websites and Services. The COS reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Websites and Services, or parts of the Websites and Services, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such use is (i) in violation of any applicable law; (ii) is harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of another person or entity; or (iii) where the COS has reason to believe that you are in violation of these Terms of Use. Termination for any reason shall not terminate any of your warranties or any of your indemnification and other obligations under these Terms of Use, or any licenses that you have or other rights that you may have granted in connection with any of your contributions.

### 22. GENERAL
The COS is based in the United States. The COS makes no claims that the data or content on its Websites or Services is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the Websites and Services may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Websites from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. These Terms are governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding that state's conflicts of laws provisions. Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Websites or Services must be brought in the state or federal courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you may have with respect to your use of the Websites or Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. Without limiting the foregoing provision, the parties agree that the Virginia Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, Virginia Code §§ 59.1-501.1 et seq ("UCITA"), is expressly excluded from these Terms and that any and all terms contained in UCITA will have no force and effect on any portion of these Terms, the Websites, or the Services. The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms, and you expressly waive all rights of application or appeal, if any, to non-U.S. courts in connection with any question of law. A party may give notice to the other party only in writing at that party's principal place of business, attention of that party's principal legal officer, or at such other address or by such other method as the party shall specify in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or facsimile with proof of receipt of transmission, or, if sent by certified mail with postage prepaid, five business days after the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, seven business days after the date of mailing. If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being affected in any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. The failure of the COS to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit the COS's rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
